This Python script automates the execution of predefined keybinds in Code Composer Studio (CSS) from the command line. It allows you to trigger common actions like build, rebuild, clean, and debug by sending the corresponding keypress events to the active window. The script also switches focus between CSS and the original window (e.g., VS Code) automatically. You can view available commands with the help argument.
